# BLPW-migration-trends
Bayesian analysis of Blackpoll Warbler population trends, based on migration counts at permanent monitoring sites and feather stable isotopes.

This code was developed for Iles et al. (2025): Large-scale population trend analysis by integrating migration counts with breeding origin estimates from feather stable isotopes: a case study with Blackpoll Warbler (Setophaga striata), published in Avian Conservation and Ecology.

This analysis estimates regional population trends in pre-defined, discrete geographic strata.  The analysis uses time series of counts across a network of migration monitoring sites, in combination with stable isotope samples from a subset of sites that are used to determine the breeding origins of birds at those locations.

Migration counts for Canadian Migration Monitoring Network stations are available from [NatureCounts](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/main.jsp).  Migration counts from US stations are available upon request from individual stations.  Stable isotope data are available upon request from
